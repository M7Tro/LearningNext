This is my notes file for the tech interview preparation for USTHING. 

There are two resources that I must master. 

10 chatpers of React foundations. 

8 chapters of  the dashboard app. 

First, what is next js?

Most popular fullstack javascript framework. 

It is a React framework for the Web. 

Features of Next.js include: built-in optimizations, dynamic HTML streaming, react server components(adding coponents without sending additional client-side JavaScript), Data fetching, CSS support, client and server rendering, server functions (running server code by running a function), route handler (building API endpoints), advanced routing and nested layouts, middleware. 

What problem does Next.js solve?

Improvement of performance, developer experience, and SEO (search engine optimization). Next.js offers SSR (server side rendering) out of the box which improves initial load time of the application. 

Essentially, for someone who already made a few projects with MERN, Next.js could be useful for better performance, SEO optimization and streamlined development. 

Another thing is that quite often, when developing a full stack app, I make an Express app for API endpoints. It means I have to run two processes (for frontend and for backend) and fix CORS errors for testing features. Next.js provides an API layers that lets you build an express app inside of the next js app (which is why it is called a full stack framework).

If you want, you can use Next.JS without any backend: just delete the API folder.
