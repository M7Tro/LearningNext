These are the notes I am taking for the full stack dashboard app tutorial in NextJS.

pnpm is recommended as the package panagare: a faster alternative to npm.  I installed it globally with npm install -g pnpm

I installed the started files with a long command: npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-dashboard --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/dashboard/starter-example" --use-pnpm
